                        <p>As a photographer I want my photos to imagine a bold, exciting world—one in which the
                            subject, be it a product or a person, stands out, shines. Viewers need to be transported,
                            and my photos achieve that through careful compositions of color and tone. This is the end
                            result of a process by which I bring the creative brief to life and make the subject part of
                            a story.
                            <br>
                            This is the power that photography’s always had for me. I recognized it when I took my first
                            photo class, back when I was growing up in Puerto Rico. So, I apprenticed with photographers
                            and shot for a variety of publications. Eventually, to continue my education, I moved to the
                            United States. Here I’ve broadened my capacities and become an art director, shepherding
                            ideas from briefs to concepts to production shoots to deliverables. To each project I bring
                            my experience and my keen eye.

                        <p class="description-text">Photographer</p>
                        <p>It is important to know that a great photographer is one who captures all that is commonly
                            unnoticed. I work with a different ‘eye’ altogether. The lens of a camera explores a world
                            of various perspectives. Some treat photography as an art, they feel it has the power to
                            manipulate realities and present them in an attractive way. Others feel that art and
                            photography are miles apart, since a photograph reflects exactly what’s in front of the
                            camera.</p>
